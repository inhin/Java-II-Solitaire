Spider Solitaire – Beginner Hints (1 Suit Version)

---------------------------------------
GOAL
---------------------------------------
Your goal is to move all cards into completed stacks
from King down to Ace. Each full stack is removed
automatically when completed.

---------------------------------------
MOVING CARDS
---------------------------------------
• Cards must be stacked in descending order:
  King → Queen → Jack → ... → Ace

• You can only move cards that are FACE UP

• You may move a stack of cards if they:
  - Are in order
  - Are the same suit

• You can place a card or stack onto another card
  only if the target card is ONE rank higher

---------------------------------------
DEALING CARDS
---------------------------------------
• You may only deal a new row when NO column is empty

• Each deal places one random card onto each column

• If a column is empty, fill it before you deal again

---------------------------------------
